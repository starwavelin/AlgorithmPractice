TwoSumClosestToTargetII (The O(nlogn) solution)
test case {2, 7, 8, 10} 14
My program returns indices 0 and 3
But the correct solution should be indices 1 and 2.

Solution on March 11, 2015
Still use the sandwich rule, but use "while (start + 1 <= end)"
instead of "while (start + 1 < end)" to traverse the whole array,
comparing all the possible diff and record the smallest diff
with its corresponding indexes.
