* Problem No. : 3
* Problem Name: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
* Problem URL : https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
* Date        : Oct 18 2017
* Author	  :	Xian Lin
* Notes       : 
* 	Scenario: 
* 		Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
* 	Assumption:
* 		1. What's the definition of substring? Consecutive characters!!! 
* 			See the 3rd example for the difference between "substring" and "subsequence".
* 		2. Can input be an empty string? Yes, then its length will be 0
* 		3. What character can be there in this string? Lower case characters only (a - z). 
	Example:
* 	Input/Output: Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
* 		Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.	
* 		Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, 
* 			"pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
* 	Data Structure and Alg:
* 		see code comments  
* Complexity  : 
* 	Time Complexity: O() -- see code comments
* 	Space Complexity: O() -- see code comments
* 
* meta        : tag-string, tag-hash, tag-array-map, tag-two-pointers

	/**
	 * Quick ref of ASCII table: http://www.asciitable.com/
	 * 	A-Z: 65-90
	 * 	a-z: 97-122
	 * Solution 1ï¼šTwo pointers
	 * 	Assume all the 256 ASCII characters are eligible to be in the input string, 
	 * then setup an array map of size 256 with the ASCII number to be the index and the latest (right) index of a char to be the value.
	 * Use two pointers, and use the right pointer to traverse the string; 
	 * and we only update the left pointer when a char appears again.
	 * 	And the left pointer = (the index of the previous appearance of this repeated character) + 1;
	 * The maxLen = (right - left + 1);
	 * 
	 * ie. Input string: abcadef	use our eyes, we can figure out the longest substring w/o repeating chars is bcadef which has length 6.
	 * Follow our algorithm,
	 * 	Step 1: Initialize array map, left pointer = right pointer = index 0.
	 * 		-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1			l = 0, r = 0
	 * 		 a,  b,  c,  d,  e,  f
	 * 	Step 2: right pointer scanned to the char that right before the repeated "a"
	 * 		 0,  1,  2, -1, -1, -1			l = 0, r = 2
	 * 		 a,  b,  c,  d,  e,  f
	 * 	Step 3: when right pointer scanned the repeated "a"
	 * 		 3,  1,  2, -1, -1, -1			l = 1, r = 3
	 * 		 a,  b,  c,  d,  e,  f
	 * 	Step 4: when right pointer scanned the repeated "a"
	 * 		 3,  1,  2,  4,  5,  6			l = 1, r = 6
	 * 		 a,  b,  c,  d,  e,  f
	 * So, maxLen = 6 - 1 + 1 = 5.
	 * 
	 * Time Complexity: O(n) - scanned the whole input string once, one pass
	 * Space Complexity: O(1) / O(n) -- need to discuss with the interviewer, cuz we open a new array of size 256
	 * 		If the intpu string has length of 1M, surely it is O(1), but if the input string is just 100 characters long, then it would be O(n)
	 *
	 * If you want another example, you can test "abcacef" which the longest substring is contributed from acef,
	 * 	when c appears the 2nd time, the l will be updated from 2 plus 1 to be 3. maxLen = 6 - 3 + 1 = 4
